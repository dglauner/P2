## Details for teaching team
I tried to do the word scraper extra, but I suck at regular expressions.  I lost a half day trying to get it to work.  
It just wasn't happening so I left it out and created a hardcoded word list as a compromise.  Because of the lost time,
the formatting is a little simpler then I might have done.

## Outside code
* The word list file was created from words coming from http://www.paulnoll.com.
